Purpose
	establish baseline and detect lie

MAJOR TASKS:
LCD
	-hook up to pulse input and resistivity sensor
	-output graph?
pulse sensor working
	---research pulse outputs
	--hook up to adc
stepper motor
	--change to move a bit
	---check torque
	--build chassis
	---buy nerf guns
	have nerf war
resistivity sensor
	--research and build circuit
	-test with LEDS

SUBTASKS:
research on lie detectors, ie how high is a nervous pulse and how resistive is a nervous resistivity
	-decide how we want to create a baseline. Do we need an input to not shoot them during baseline questions?
look at pulse sensor data sheet
	-figure out how to connect and use it
resistivity sensor circuit design
	-draw diagram and build it for testing
