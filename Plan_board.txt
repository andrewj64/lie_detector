Purpose
	establish baseline and detect lie

MAJOR TASKS:
LCD
	-hook up to pulse input and resistivity sensor
	-output graph?
pulse sensor working
	---research pulse outputs
stepper motor
	--build chassis
resistivity sensor
	-test with LEDS

SUBTASKS:
research on lie detectors, ie how high is a nervous pulse and how resistive is a nervous resistivity
	-decide how we want to create a baseline. Do we need an input to not shoot them during baseline questions?
look at pulse sensor data sheet
	-use that data to get bpm
	-research how much bpm constitutes a lie
resistivity sensor circuit design
	-test to see what kind of variation we can say is a lie
